<h2>BBC News and Chat Apps</h2>

<p>BBC News has led the way in innovating editorial products inside a range of chat apps, the instant messaging platforms that have seen huge user growth in the past 18 months.</p>

<p>It was the first news brand to offer a news service inside WhatsApp - for Indians wanting to follow the latest on the country's elections. It was also the first international news brand to launch on WeChat (BBC India) and on LINE (a global news account). BBC News is now the biggest global news brand on LINE - approaching 400,000 followers.</p>

<p>With a strategy to reach audiences in emerging markets, often with limited data connectivity and affordability, Africa has also been a particular focus for BBC News. A BBM (Blackberry) channel was launched by the BBC Hausa service, serving content to people in Nigeria in local language. During the South African elections, BBC News offered young (and often poor) South Africans an alternative source of news and a platform to share their experiences and thoughts on the MXIT app.</p>

<p>As part of its commitment to serve its audiences in affected regions, BBC News launched a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-29573964">'lifeline' Ebola information service</a> on WhatsApp. With over 20,000 subscribers - the majority in the affected countries - the WhatsApp account sent daily push alerts with public health information in text, images and audio clips in both English and French.</p>

<p>Since the BBC piloted and launched these services, many news organisations around the world have followed suit and are now experimenting on these platforms.</p>

<h2>BBC Pop Up</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-28843888">BBC Pop Up</a> is a new six month pilot of our first mobile bureau, which launched in Colorado in September 2014.</p>

<p>This traveling news office is relocating to a new US town each month to crowdsource story ideas from community residents. Upon arrival in each new location, the team hosts meet-ups where residents come out and suggest local issues they'd like the BBC to broadcast to its global audience. BBC Pop Up video journalists then make weekly video features and monthly documentaries for World television and online. The team also offers free weekly journalism workshops at universities and bases itself in shared work spaces.</p>
